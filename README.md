SparseSim is a sparse-state-vector simulator built on C/C++ kernels wrapped in Cython.

- **Wavefunction** and **PauliSum** classes let you prototype and benchmark quantum algorithms efficiently.  
- A **fermionic toolkit** (Fermionic Operators, Hamiltonian, Reduced Density Matrices (RDM), Projection) supports simulations of electronic-structure models and subspace-restricted dynamics.  
- The **qiskit_wrapper** module makes it easy to port these algorithms to quantum devices.
