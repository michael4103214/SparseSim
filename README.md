SparseSim is a lightweight sparse-state-vector simulator built on C/C++ kernels wrapped in Cython.
	•	Wavefunction and PauliSum classes let you prototype and benchmark quantum algorithms efficiently.
	•	A fermionic toolkit (FermionicOperator, Hamiltonian, Reduced Density Matrices (RDM), Projection) supports simulations of electronic-structure models and other subspace-restricted dynamics.
	•	The qiskit_wrapper module makes it easy to port these algorithms to quantum devices.
